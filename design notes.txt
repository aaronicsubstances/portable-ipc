ScalableIPC Notes
===========
C#.NET Core implementation
- exception stacktrace in promise rejection (e.g during send if prev send pending) not showing in tests. Will they also be missing outside test environment?
- which interface methods are going to be virtual, or all? Session handler, Endpoint handler, etc? 
- add try catch as much as possible for robustness

Event Loop Libraries
---------------------
Java - Use ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor with 1 thread.
C# - Custom task scheduler with no parallelism and synchronization lock, to effectively resemble Java's case, and CancellationToken for cancelTimeout
NodeJS - setImmediate().
*Consider Python since it has event loop, future, async sleep
*Consider PHP too since it has event loop, guzzlehttp has promises, ReactPHP has setTimeout, so its implementation can proceed like NodeJS
