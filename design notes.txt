ScalableIPC Notes
===========
C#.NET Core implementation
- exception stacktrace in promise rejection (e.g during send if prev send pending) not showing in tests. Will they also be missing outside test environment?
- which interface methods are going to be virtual, or all? Prefer containment to inheritance.
- add try catch as much as possible for robustness

Event Loop Libraries
---------------------
C# - Custom task scheduler with no parallelism and synchronization lock, and CancellationToken for cancelTimeout
Java - Port C# solution.
NodeJS - setImmediate().
*Consider Python since it has event loop, future, async sleep
Ruby?

Web Server Interfaces for use with HTTP frameworks over non-TCP
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Python - WSGI
C#.NET Core - OWIN
Ruby - Rack
Java - Servlet Container. Undertow.io looks like what will fit our purpose, by writing custom listeners and handlers, and handling async I/O.

NodeJS - Effectively http.createServer(app). where app is the framework (e.g. ExpressJs).
 - Basically mimick http module. And then when http.createServer(app) is called, our internal logic kicks in. Example: https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fastcgi

*For client calls, libraries will have to be built for each platform
